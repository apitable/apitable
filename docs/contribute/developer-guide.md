# Developer Guide

This guide helps you get started developing APITable.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies and programming languages installed before setting up your developer environment:

- `git`
- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [docker-compose v2](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- `make`


### Programming Language

If you are using macOS or Linux.
We recommend install programming language with SDK manager `sdkman` and `nvm`.

```bash
# quick install nvm
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
# quick install sdkman
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
# install nodejs 
nvm install 16.15.0 && nvm use 16.15.0 && corepack enable
# install java development kit
sdk env install
# install rust toolchain
curl -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- --default-toolchain nightly --profile minimal -y && source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
```

### macOS

We recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for installing any missing dependencies:

```bash
## necessary required
brew install git
brew install --cask docker
brew install make
brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg pixman
```

### Linux

On CentOS / RHEL or other Linux distribution with `yum`

```bash
sudo yum install git
sudo yum install make
```

On Ubuntu / Debian or other Linux distribution with `apt`

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install make
```


### Windows

If you are running APITable on Windows 10/11, we recommend installing [Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), [Ubuntu on WSL](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) and [Windows Terminal](https://aka.ms/terminal),
You can learn more about Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in [the official site](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl).

Install missing dependencies on Ubuntu using `apt`:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install make
```


## What Build Tool we use?

We use `make` as our centric build tool entry that drives other build tool like `gradle` / `npm` / `yarn`.

So you can just input `make` command and see all build commands:

```bash
make
```

## How to start development environment?

APITable consists of 3 processes:

1. backend-server
2. room-server
3. web-server

To start the development environment locally, run these commands:

```bash
# start databases in dockers
make dataenv 

# install dependencies
make install 

#start backend-server
make run # enter 1  

# and then switch to a new terminal
# start room-server
make run # enter 2

# and then switch to a new terminal
# start web-server
make run # enter 3

```




## What IDE should you use?

We recommend you use `Visual Studio Code` or `Intellij IDEA` for your IDE.

APITable have prepared these two IDE's debug configs.

Just open APITable's root directory with IDE.



## How to contribute translations?

We accept two ways to perfect the multilingual translation of your project:

1. Modify the source code and submit a PR
2. Find the `strings` to be modified in [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/apitablecode) and modify them online

In the collaboration of multilingual translation, we follow the following process:

## How to configure the SMTP server?

By default, APITable doesn't configure the SMTP server, which means you cannot invite users since it require the email sending feature.

It is needed to modify `.env` configuration using self email, and restart backend server.

```
MAIL_ENABLED=true
MAIL_HOST=smtp.xxx.com
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password
MAIL_PORT=465
MAIL_SSL_ENABLE=true
MAIL_TYPE=smtp
MAIL_USERNAME=your_email
```

In addition, some mailboxes need to be enabled in the background to use smtp.
For details, you can search for xxx mailbox smtp tutorial.

## Where is the API documentation?

You can access the API documentation by starting a local server:

1. The documentation address for the Backend server is: http://localhost:8081/api/v1/doc.html

2. The documentation address for the Room server is: http://localhost:3333/nest/v1/docs

If you are interested in cloud service API interfaces, you can also directly access the online API documentation at https://developers.apitable.com/api/introduction.

## How to set the limitation of widget quantity in dashboard? (30 by default)

This can be achieved by setting the `DSB_WIDGET_MAX_COUNT` parameter in the `.env` file.

## Can I increase request rate limit of the API? (5 by default)

In the `.env.default` file of `room-server`, there are two parameters that can adjust request frequency:

1. You can set `LIMIT_POINTS` and `LIMIT_DURATION` to indicate the number of requests that can be made in a unit time period. Where LIMIT_POINTS is the number of times and LIMIT_DURATION is the duration, measured in seconds.

2. You can set the parameter `LIMIT_WHITE_LIST` to set a separate request frequency for specific users. Its value is a JSON string, and its structure can refer to `Map<string, IBaseRateLimiter>`.

## How to increase the number of records inserted per API call? (10 by default)

This can be achieved by setting the `API_MAX_MODIFY_RECORD_COUNTS` parameter in the `.env.default` file of `room-server`.


## How to upgrade to the newest release version?


## How to change the default 80 port?
Configuration properties in  the `.env` file can also be overridden  by specifying them env vars `NGINX_HTTP_PORT`

For example. It would be set as NGINX_HTTP_PORT=8080
