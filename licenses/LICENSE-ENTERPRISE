THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT AND THE ORDER FOR THE SOFTWARE THAT YOU AGREED TO (“ORDER”), AND [(WHERE APPLICABLE) ANY APITable LICENSE KEY INFORMATION (“LICENSE KEY” AND, [COLLECTIVELY WITH THE ORDER AND] THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT, THIS “AGREEMENT”) ARE AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND APITable, INC. (“APITable”) AND GOVERN USE OF THE SOFTWARE, UNLESS YOU AND APITable HAVE EXECUTED A SEPARATE WRITTEN AGREEMENT GOVERNING USE OF THE SOFTWARE.

APITable is willing to license the Software to you only upon the condition that you accept all the terms contained in this Agreement. By downloading, installing or using the Software, you have indicated that you understand this Agreement and accept all of its terms. If you are accepting the terms of this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to the terms of this Agreement, and, in such event, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity. If you do not accept all of the terms of this Agreement, then APITable is unwilling to license the Software to you, and you must return the Software to APITable or destroy all copies of the Software.

1. License.
1.1 License Grant. Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including payment of the applicable fees in accordance with Section 3), APITable grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, worldwide limited license to (a) use the software products internally, in executable code form, and related Documentation (as defined in Section 6.1), as specified in the Order, including any error corrections, modifications and updates thereto provided by APITable to you under this Agreement (the “Software”), but only in the Licensed Configuration and only during the term of this Agreement and (b) copy and adapt the Software as provided herein. For purposes of this Agreement, “Licensed Configuration” means the features and usage limits for a specified time period, in each case, as specified in the Order. Your use of the Software is further limited according to the license type and other terms in the Order. You may copy the Software, as reasonably required to exercise your rights under this Section 1.1, and you may make a reasonable number of copies for backup or archival purposes.

1.2 Benefit of Third Parties. If the Order specifies a Right to Embed the Software for the benefit of end users, then the license in Section 1.1 shall be modified to allow you to operate the Software within a Customer Application (identified on the Order Form) and allow your end user customers (“End Users”) to access the Software as a part of the Customer Application.

1.3. Distribution License. If the Order specifies a Right to Distribute, then subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including payment of the applicable fees in accordance with Section 3), APITable grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicenseable, worldwide limited license to distribute the Software to End Users (i) as embedded in the Customer Application identified in the Order Form, (ii) solely for use by the end users of the Customer Application and not for further distribution and (iii) provided the End User executes an end user license agreement that protects APITable to the same extent this Agreement protects APITable (“End User License Agreement”).

1.4. Source Code Access; Modifications. Solely if your license type and pricing tier, as specified in the Order, includes access to the source code of the Software, subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including payment of the applicable fees in accordance with Section 3), APITable grants to you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide limited license to (i) use, reproduce, modify and create derivative works based upon the Software, solely for the purpose of customizing the Software to interface, embed, combine, or otherwise use with your products or services (as distributed to your customers). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, you agree that you have the right to use any and all modifications, customizations, enhancements and extensions to the Software to the same extent, and solely to such extent, that you have the right to use the Software pursuant to this Agreement and your valid subscription. In addition, APITable prohibits you from modifying, and you agree not to modify, the Software (a) to enable features not available to customers at your license type and pricing tier as found on APITable.com/pricing ; or (b) to disable usage limits.

1.5. Limited Rights; License Restrictions. Your rights in the Software will be limited to those expressly granted in this Agreement. APITable reserves all rights and licenses in and to the Software not expressly granted to you under this Agreement. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, you will not: (i) copy or modify the Software, in whole or in part; (ii) transfer, sublicense, lease, lend or rent or otherwise distribute the Software to any third party; (iii) make the functionality of the Software available to third-party users through any means, including but not limited to by uploading the Software to a network or file-sharing service or through any hosting, application services provider, service bureau, software-as-a-service (SaaS) or any other type of services, except as integrated into and offered as part of your Licensed Product; or (iv) disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Software or permit or authorize a third party to do so, except to the extent such restrictions are expressly prohibited by law.

1.6. Ownership. You expressly acknowledge that, as between APITable and you, APITable and its licensors own all worldwide right, title and interest in and to the Software, including all worldwide patent rights, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how and any other intellectual property rights embodied therein. You will not delete or in any manner alter the copyright, trademark or other proprietary rights notices appearing on the Software as delivered to you. You will reproduce such notices on all copies you make of the Software. Subject to Section 1.4, you will own your modifications to the Software (“Modifications”); provided that your ownership thereof will be subject to APITables’s underlying intellectual property rights in the Software. At your option, you may submit your Modifications to the APITable open source project. In addition, you own all worldwide right, title and interest in and to all your data that is processed by the Software and the analyses that are generated by the Software based on such data.

1.7. Verification and Audit. At APITable’s written request, you will furnish APITable with an officer’s written certification verifying that the Software is being used in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Upon at least thirty (30) days prior written notice, APITable may audit your use of the Software to ensure that you are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, provided that no audit may take longer than 30 days to complete, and further provided that all individuals involved in the audit must sign a non-disclosure agreement consistent with Section 5, make no copies of documents, remove no materials from your premises, and agree to comply with all of your reasonable rules, policies and instructions that apply to persons accessing your premises or systems . If an audit reveals that you have underpaid fees to APITable during the period audited, then you will promptly pay APITable for such underpaid fees based on APITable’s price list in effect at the time the audit is completed.

2. Obligations and Support.
2.1 Customer Support by APITable. Subject to your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including payment of the applicable fees in accordance with Section 3), APITable will make available to you at no additional cost APITable’s standard support for the license type and pricing tier specified in the Order in accordance with APITable’s then-standard support terms, attached hereto as Schedule A. APITable reserves the right to designate any additional new content or features as requiring separate payment or purchase of a separate subscription at any time. If you have entered into a separate support or similar agreement with APITable, then APITable will provide Software maintenance and support in accordance with the terms of that agreement, not this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, APITable shall have no obligation to provide support to End Users or any users of the Customer Application.

2.2 Customer Obligations. Customer shall make no representations or warranties with respect to the Software or any related services beyond those contained herein. Customer shall be solely responsible for, and APITable shall have no legal obligation to honor, any warranties that Customer provides to End Users to the extent that such warranties are broader or greater in scope than those made by APITable to Customer hereunder. Customer shall defend, indemnify and hold APITable and its affiliated companies harmless from any and all costs, losses, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorney’s fees and costs of litigation) resulting from Customer’s failure to comply with this Section.

3. Payment.
3.1 Subscription Fees. You will pay the fees and charges stated in the Order (“Subscription Fees”) for use of the Software. The base Subscription Fee for each Subscription Term (as defined in Section 4) will be specified in the Order (“Base Subscription Fee”) and is payable and charged at the beginning of each Subscription Term.

3.2 Units; True-Up. If specified in the Order, Subscription Fees will be calculated based on units of use of the Software (such as per server, per installation, per customer or per user) (each, a “Unit”). Where applicable, the Base Subscription Fee includes the number of Units specified in the Order for each Subscription Term. At the end of each Subscription Term, you will promptly confirm in writing to APITable (at the latest within five (5) business days of a request from APITable) the number of Units used by you during that Subscription Term. If your actual usage of the Software exceeds the Units covered by the Base Subscription Fee prepaid by you for a Subscription Term, APITable will charge you for the difference between the Units covered by the Base Subscription Fee and the number of Units actually used by you during that Subscription Term (“Additional Units Fee”).

3.3 Payment Terms. If you have provided us with credit card details, we will charge that credit card: (i) at the start of each Subscription Term, for the Base Subscription Fee; and (ii) promptly after receipt of your report under Section 3.2 (or the results of an audit under Section 1.5), any Additional Units Fee payable by you (if any). We will issue a payment confirmation to you with respect to any charges we have made to your credit card. If we issue an invoice to you, all invoices are payable as specified in the Payment Terms section of the Order (or if not so specified, within thirty (30) days of receipt). All amounts are stated and shall be paid in US dollars and are exclusive of taxes, duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (except taxes based on APITable’s earnings or income) (collectively, “Taxes”). You are responsible for payment of all Taxes and any related interest and/or penalties resulting from any payments made to us, other than any taxes based on APITable’s net income. Except as specifically outlined in Section 4 and Section 7.3, all fees are non-refundable.

4. Term and Termination.
This Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of this Section 4, will continue in effect for the initial subscription term specified in the Order. At the end of such initial subscription term and each renewal subscription term thereafter, subject always to timely payment of the Subscription Fees, this Agreement will automatically renew for additional renewal subscription terms having the duration specified in the Order (or if no renewal term length is stated in the Order, having the same duration as the Initial Subscription Term), unless either party provides at least 30 days’ prior written notice of non-renewal. Such initial subscription term and each renewal subscription term are each individually referred to herein as a “Subscription Term.” Each party will have the right to terminate this Agreement if the other party breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such breach within 10 days after written notice thereof, provided that, for breaches that cannot be cured using reasonable efforts within 10 days, then up to an additional 20 days to cure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you fail to pay the applicable fees as specified in the Order and this Agreement, and that failure persists for 5 days after written notice, your license to the Software ends automatically. You acknowledge that upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, the Software and any license key may automatically de-activate and you may no longer be able to access and use the Software. Upon termination: (1), you must, at APITable’s option, either promptly destroy or return to APITable all copies of the Software and any APITable Confidential Information in your possession or control, provided that, upon agreeing to pay 25% of the prior years’ fee, we will allow you and your customers to continue to use the APITable Software for an additional three months; and (2) you shall not be entitled to a refund of any pre-paid fees, except that you will be entitled to a refund of pre-paid fees if this Agreement is terminated by you for our breach and as provided in Section 7.3. Sections 4, 5, 6.3, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 will survive any expiration or termination of the Agreement. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, the rights granted in Section 1.1 and 1.2 and 1.3 shall immediately terminate and you must ensure that your End Users delete the Customer Application.

5. Confidentiality.
Continuing until 5 years after the expiration or termination of this Agreement, each party (as such, a “recipient”) agrees to keep all information, documents and data received from the other party (as such, a “discloser”), which are marked as or which would reasonably be considered to be confidential (“Confidential Information”) as strictly confidential and to use such information only as follows: (i) with respect to APITable Confidential Information, within the scope of the licenses granted to you, and (ii) with respect to your Confidential Information, only as needed to provide you with the Software and services contemplated by this Agreement. The Software and its pricing are APITable’s Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, “Confidential Information” shall not include any information, proven by documentation, which: (i) becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the recipient; (ii) was available to the recipient on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by the discloser; (iii) becomes available to the recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the discloser, provided that such source is not known by the recipient to be bound by any duty to the discloser or another entity, to keep such information confidential; or (iv) is independently developed by the recipient, without use of the discloser’s Confidential Information.

6. Warranties.
6.1. Limited Software Warranty APITable warrants that, for thirty (30) days following the Effective Date, the Software will perform in all material respects in accordance with the standard user documentation for the Software that APITable makes generally available to its customers (“Documentation”). As your sole and exclusive remedy and APITable’s entire liability for any breach of this limited warranty, APITable will at its option and expense promptly correct or replace the Software so that it conforms to this limited warranty. APITable does not warrant that the Software will meet your requirements, that the Software will operate in the combinations that you may select, that the operation of the Software will be error-free or uninterrupted, or that all Software errors will be corrected. The limited warranty set forth in this Section 6.1 does not apply to the extent that APITable provides you with the Software (or portions of the Software) for beta, evaluation, testing, or demonstration purposes.

6.2. No Excluded Licenses The Software and Documentation do not incorporate, combine with, or use software or materials distributed under an Excluded License (“Open Source Materials”). “Excluded License” means a license that requires, as a condition of use, modification, and/or distribution of such Open Source Materials that other software incorporated into, derived from, or distributed with such Open Source Materials be (i) disclosed or distributed in source code form, (ii) licensed for the purpose of making derivative works, or (iii) redistributedable at no charge.

6.3. Disclaimer EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. APITable DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED FROM APITable OR ELSEWHERE WILL CREATE ANY WARRANTY NOT EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

7. Indemnification.
7.1 APITable Indemnity. APITable will defend, indemnify and hold you harmless from and against any damages, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees and other professional fees) awarded against you in a final non-appealable judgment or that are agreed to in settlement, to the extent based on a third-party claim that the Software, as provided by APITable to you, infringes any patent, copyright or misappropriates any trade secret of any third party; provided that you: (a) promptly notify APITable in writing of any such claim; (b) grant APITable sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim; and (c) provide APITable, at APITable’s expense, with all assistance, information and authority reasonably required for the defense and settlement of the claim.

APITable will not be liable for any settlement or compromise that you enter into without APITable’s prior written consent.

7.2 Exclusions. APITable’s obligation to indemnify you pursuant to Section 7.1 will not apply to the extent any claim results from or is based on: (i) any combination, operation or use of the Software with any product, system, device, method or data not provided by APITable, if such claim would have been avoided but for such combination, operation or use; (ii) modification of the Software by anyone other than APITable, if a claim would have been avoided but for such modification; (iii) your failure to install and use any upgrades to the Software furnished by APITable, if such claim could have been avoided by such installation and use of such upgrades; or (iv) use of the Software other than in accordance with this Agreement. You will indemnify, defend and hold APITable harmless and will pay any costs damages and reasonable attorney’s fees in connection with any third party claim to the extent it results from any of the foregoing activities in this Section 7.2, provided that APITable (a) promptly notifies you in writing of any such claim; (b) grants you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim; and (c) provides you, at your expense, with all assistance, information and authority reasonably required for the defense and settlement of the claim.

7.3 Injunction. If your use of the Software is, or in APITable’s opinion is likely to be, enjoined due to the type of claim specified in Section 7.1, then APITable will at its sole option and expense: procure for you the right to continue using the Software under the terms of this Agreement; (ii) replace or modify the Software to make it non-infringing and of equivalent functionality; or (iii) if APITable is unable to accomplish either (i) or despite using its reasonable efforts, then APITable may terminate your rights and APITable’s obligation under this Agreement with respect to such Software and refund to you a pro-rata portion of the prepaid license fees you paid for such Software.

7.4 Customer Indemnity. In the event Customer has rights granted under Sections 1.2 and 1.3 herein, Customer agrees to defend and indemnify APITable, at Customer’s expense, against any legal action brought against APITable by a third party to the extent that it is based on a claim that Customer Application or any software, hardware, materials or technology therein (except for Software), or the combination of the Software with any other software, hardware, materials or technology used by Customer as part of the applicable Customer Application, infringes a patent, copyright or trademark of such third party or makes unlawful use of such party’s trade secret, and Customer shall pay any settlement of such claim or final judgment against APITable in any such action if attributable to any such claim. However, such defense and payments are subject to the conditions that APITable must: (i) notify Customer promptly in writing of such claim, (ii) permit Customer to have sole control of the defense, compromise or settlement of such claim, including any appeals, and (iii) fully cooperate with Customer, at Customer’s expense, in the defense or settlement of such claim.

7.5 Sole Remedy. THIS SECTION 7 SETS FORTH APITable’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATIONS, AND YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES, WITH RESPECT TO INFRINGEMENT OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF ANY KIND.

8. Limitation of Liability.

EACH PARTY’S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, FROM ALL CAUSES OF ACTION AND ALL THEORIES OF LIABILITY, WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID TO APITable BY YOU FOR THE SPECIFIC SOFTWARE GIVING RISE TO A CLAIM FOR LIABILITY HEREUNDER DURING THE 12 MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE FIRST CLAIM, PROVIDED THAT THIS SHALL NOT RELEASE YOU FROM PAYING ALL FEES AND CHARGES DUE HEREUNDER. The parties agree that the limitations and exclusions contained in this Section 8 and elsewhere in this Agreement will (a) not apply to any claims under indemnity and (b) survive and apply even if any exclusive remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

9. U.S. Government End Users.

If the Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government, then, as provided in FAR 12.212 and DFARS 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the U.S. Government’s rights in the Software will be only those specified in this Agreement.

By providing Feedback, you grant APITable a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, sublicenseable, fully-paid and royalty-free license to use and exploit in any manner such Feedback.

12. General.
This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to or application of conflict of laws rules or principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply. Any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in the Northern District of California and each party irrevocably consents to the personal jurisdiction thereof and venue therein.

All notices or approvals will be sent to the addresses set forth in the Order or to such other address as may be specified by either party to the other in accordance with this Section.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent possible, and the other provisions will remain in full force and effect.
