# APITable licenses and terms of service

Here are the main licenses of note.

## APITable Open Source Edition

##### [GNU Affero General Public License](https://github.com/apitable/apitable/blob/main/LICENSE) (AGPL)

If you remove the “Powered by APITable” logo on embedded APITable page, you’d then need to release your own embedding application under the AGPL. To avoid this, you can instead purchase an Enterprise Edition package.

## APITable Embedding License

##### [Advanced embedding license](./licenses/LICENSE-EMBEDDING)

Our Advanced Embedding License allows you to remove the “Powered by APITable” logo on embedded on embedded APITable page without making the embedding application subject to the AGPL.
