# Redux Slices
> https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-2-app-structure

A "slice" is a collection of Redux reducer logic and actions for a single feature in your app, typically defined together in a single file. The name comes from splitting up the root Redux state object into multiple "slices" of state.

Here we create the state of the datasheet and the state of the widget as distinct "slices", each containing the full action/reducer/selector
