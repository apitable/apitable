/**
 * The NumberField class has some special handling for dealing with trailing
 * decimal points and/or zeroes. This logic is designed to allow trailing values
 * to be visible in the input element, but not be represented in the
 * corresponding form data.
 *
 * The algorithm is as follows:
 *
 * 1. When the input value changes the value is cached in the component state
 *
 * 2. The value is then normalized, removing trailing decimal points and zeros,
 *    then passed to the "onChange" callback
 *
 * 3. When the component is rendered, the formData value is checked against the
 *    value cached in the state. If it matches the cached value, the cached
 *    value is passed to the input instead of the formData value
