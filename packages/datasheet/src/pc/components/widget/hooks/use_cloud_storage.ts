/**
 * Widget data storage.
 * For the currently running widget, provide a `useState` - like interface to store, 
 * data is read and written by a specified key, 
 * if you set the value multiple times the data will be sent to the collaborator at 500ms intervals, 
 * key-value pairs are stored persistently. 
 * When the value changes, re-render is triggered, changes in value may from other collaborator, 
 * and it is not recommended to set default value when the widget first installed, because the initial default value 
 * is the same of multiple collaborators. Setting defaults multiple times can result in pointless performance waste or event dead loops, 
 * and data should be set up after changes in external data.
