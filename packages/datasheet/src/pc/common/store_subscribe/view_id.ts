   * Purpose: If there is no viewId, then jump to the currently active view, i.e. the first view
   * 1. when viewId == null, although the intention is to jump to a particular view, 
   * the redux will be triggered frequently during the jump, resulting in multiple calls to changeView.
   * In the context of the above, the previousDatasheetActiveViewId ! == datasheetActiveViewId to reduce the number of changeView calls
   * 2. The reason is that the mirror and the original table share a copy of the data, 
   * and when jumping from the mirror to the original table, the previousDatasheetActiveViewId must be equal to
   * datasheetActiveViewIdã€‚So a new previousMirrorId && !mirrorId is added to determine 
   * if the current route is leaving from a mirror when the previous condition is false
   * (PS: In addition to the above idea, there is another way to update the data in the pageParams immediately, 
   * the reason for this problem is that the routing changes do not update the pageParams immediately, 
   * so as long as the pageParams are updated in time, this problem can also be avoided.
   * (However, in the current project, pageParams are modified via the usePageParams hook, 
   * so this solution is not used in order not to break the logic)
